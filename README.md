### Goal of the project

Make a scalable and easy to evolve ML project. The delivered product is based on the fictional item "pokedex" of the game franchise Pokemon. Basically we trained a convolutional neural network to recognise images of certain pokemon. For now only pikachu and rondoudou can be recognized, but by adding new data we could add more pokemons.
